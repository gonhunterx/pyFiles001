I want to create some sort of system where the shop sells an item that makes you get +1 efficency. 

This means you go collect resources and then you sell them to the shop. 
He gives you gold for the wood or fish then you collect the gold. Once you have enough gold you buy the 
upgrade. 

Then the price of the upgrade goes up. I'll probably just make that double or something. 
The efficency will just go up 1x each purchase of the shop keepers item.
